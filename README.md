# VK RecSys Challenge
## Building a model that will predict future likes/dislikes of users
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a user will like or dislike a particular content based on their historical interactions. The model utilizes two powerful algorithms: CatBoost and LSTM, followed by stacking with Logistic Regression to improve performance.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Data Preprocessing:

Run src/data_preprocessing.py to clean and prepare the raw data for modeling.

Feature Engineering:

Run src/feature_engineering.py to generate new features from the preprocessed data.

Model Training:

Train individual models (CatBoost and LSTM) using src/model_training.py.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of each model using src/model_evaluation.py.

Stacking:

Combine the predictions from CatBoost and LSTM models using logistic regression in notebooks/Stacking_Model.ipynb.
